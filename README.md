# Orca.ai-assignment

This project is a Next.js application developed as an assignment for an interview with a company. The project includes various UI components and functionalities such as loading states, setup borders and scrollbars, dropdown icons, and responsiveness enhancements.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd orca.ai-assignment
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

This is how the project looks so far
